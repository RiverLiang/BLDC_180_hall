Module "FMSTR1"    (component FreeMaster)
   - FMSTR1_Poll -In the poll-driven or short interrupt modes, this function handles the protocol decoding and execution. In 
                the poll-driven mode, this function also handles the SCI communication. In the long interrupt mode, this 
                function compiles as an empty function and may still be called.
   - FMSTR1_Recorder -Recorder worker routine. This returns quickly if recorder is not running, otherwise it calls quite 
                lengthy recorder routine which does all the recorder work (sampling, triggering).   This method is enabled only 
                if the Recorder property is enabled.
   - FMSTR1_TriggerRec -Pull the trigger of the recorder. This function starts the post-trigger stop countdown.  This method is 
                enabled only if the Recorder property is enabled.

Module "Cap0"      (component Capture)
   - Cap0_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap0_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "Cap1"      (component Capture)
   - Cap1_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap1_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "Cap2"      (component Capture)
   - Cap2_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap2_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "PWMA"      (component Init_eFlexPWM_56800)
   - PWMA_Init -This method initializes registers of the eFlexPWM module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "F6"        (component BitIO)
   - F6_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - F6_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - F6_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - F6_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - F6_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "E7"        (component BitIO)
   - E7_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - E7_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - E7_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - E7_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - E7_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "PIT_1ms"   (component TimerInt)
   - PIT_1ms_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).

Module "QSPI0"     (component Init_SPI_56800)
   - QSPI0_Init -This method initializes registers of the SPI module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "F0"        (component BitIO)
   - F0_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - F0_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - F0_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - F0_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Sets low power mode - Wait mode.   For more information about the wait mode see this CPU documentation.   
                Release from wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Sets low power mode - Stop mode.   For more information about the stop mode see this CPU documentation.
